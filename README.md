# Sebra ðŸ¦“
Sebra is a tool for online vendors to collect payments/donations through Libra. Vendors (businesses, content creators, musicians etc) can generate a code snippet to be integrated with their blog/online store etc. Sebra aims to create a simple user experience that allows users to make simple payments and vendors to get paid without dealing with the complexities of public/private keys. 

Workflow:
1) Vendor generates code snippet to add to their site. This generates a *'Pay with Libra'* button.

2) Payer creates a new account or logs in via an existing account.
